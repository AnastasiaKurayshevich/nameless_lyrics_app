# nameless_lyrics_app
Song lyrics generator app powered by AI. 

### nameless_team's final project idea: Song Lyrics Generator connected with OpenAI API. 
The premiss of the project is to create mobile app where User can input some values like style, mood of the song, artists the User is inspired of, structure of the song. User can also give a description on what the song is about and/or input some lyrics that should be in the song. After the User is satisfied with the input, the songs lyrics are generated. User now can edit song components (verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, etc.), change the structure of the song by draging and dropping components, regenerate chosen components or regenereate the whole song. 

After the User is satisfied with the result, the song can be saved into User's personal songs list. From that list User can access existing songs, search through the list, edit or delete specific song.  

The app will only generate text lyrics of the song, no music will be generated. 

Described above is a basic functionality of the application that we aim to accive. If time allows we are planing to introduce extra features: 
- Autentification: sing up and log in pages, so multiple Users could access their personal accounts.
- Social connections: create an interface for Users to interact with each other's profiles - upvote other User's songs, save them to list of favourits.
- Filtering: filter the list of songs based on different input cathegories.
- Multiple lyric options: while generating the song we give the User multiple song options generated based on the same input, so the User could chose.
- Saving the song as PDF: inplementing the fuctionality to save the lyrics in PDF format.
- Sharing the song: giving the User possibility to share the song via social media by pressing the button.
