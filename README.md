# lyrigator_lyrics_app
A powerful AI-driven song lyrics generator application.

### nameless_team's Final Project Idea: Song Lyrics Generator connected with OpenAI API
The premise of this project is to develop a mobile app that allows users to generate song lyrics based on their inputs. Users can specify the style, mood, and artists that inspire them, as well as provide a description or input specific lyrics for the song. Once the user is satisfied with their input, the app will generate the lyrics accordingly. Users will also have the ability to modify song components such as verses, pre-choruses, choruses, bridges, etc. They can drag and drop components to change the song's structure, edit, delete or regenerate selected sections, or regenerate the entire song.

Once users are satisfied with the generated lyrics, they can save the song to their personal songs list. Within this list, users can access existing songs, search through the collection, and edit or delete specific songs.

It's important to note that the app will only generate text lyrics and will not provide music composition.

The aforementioned functionality represents the core features that we aim to achieve. If time permits, we plan to introduce additional features, including:

- Authentication: Implement sign-up and log-in pages to allow multiple users to access their personal accounts.
- Social connections: Create an interface for users to interact with each other's profiles, such as upvoting other users' songs or saving them as favorites.
- Filtering: Enable users to filter their song list based on various categories.
- Multiple lyric options: Provide users with multiple song options generated based on the same input, allowing them to choose their preferred version.
- Saving the song as PDF: Implement functionality to save lyrics in PDF format.
- Sharing the song: Allow users to share their songs via social media platforms by simply pressing a button.

By incorporating these additional features, we aim to enhance the user experience and offer a comprehensive song lyrics generation platform.
